# ExerciseSearching
This project is planning to use the Exercise API from Rapid: https://rapidapi.com/mortimerbrian135/api/exerciseapi3
Use this API to find out what kind of muscles we can exercise, and search exercises depend on name of exercise and muscle. 
User can store the exercise into CoreData.
